Hello. You're probably wondering how you run the tests for this project given that the README file just contains the generic instructions from Code Quarterly.

Do this:
cd code
ant

The project uses Ant to build everything. The default target runs all the tests.

Some targets you should know about:
ant unittest
ant functionaltest
ant test (this runs both the unit and functional tests)
